    <h2 class="md-title">Climbing Performance Test</h2>
    <p>
      This is a really good self assessment test to work out your key strengths
      and weaknesses (check out Eric J. HÃ¶rst's book
			<a href="http://www.trainingforclimbing.com/" target="_blank">Training for Climbing</a>).
			It's good to take stock especially if your performance has plateaued.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you answer all the questions, we'll add up each category to attain
      three totals. If all three areas are within five points of each other you
      are a well-balanced climber but, more commonly, you will have one that is
      much lower scoring than the others. This is your major weakness. Review
      each question of the self-assessment test and mark a star next to those
      on which you scored a three or less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these low scoring questions identifies a specific element of your
			climbing performance that is holding you back. Focus on your most
			dramatic weaknesses (5-6 lowest scoring items). Work out an action plan
			then once you begin to see improvement shift your focus onto other low
			scoring areas of the assessment. Re-take the test if needs be.
