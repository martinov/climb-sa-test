    <p>
      Here's a good way to assess your climbing performance and work out your
      key strengths and weaknesses (check out Eric J. HÃ¶rst's book
      <a href="http://www.trainingforclimbing.com/" target="_blank">Training for Climbing</a>).
      It's good to take stock especially if your performance has plateaued.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you answer all the questions, we add up the scores and split them
      in three categroies - <span>Mental</span>, <span>Technique and Tactics</span>
      and <span>Physical</span>, to attain three totals. If all three areas are
      within five points of each other you are a well-balanced climber but,
      more commonly, you will have one that is much lower scoring than the others.
      This is your major weakness.
    </p>

      We'll follow up by reviewing each question of the test and highlighting
      those on which you scored a three or less. Each of these low scoring
      questions identifies a specific element of your	climbing performance that
      is holding you back. Focus on your most dramatic weaknesses
      (5-6 lowest scoring items). Work out an action plan then once you begin
      to see improvement shift your focus onto other low scoring areas of the
      assessment. Re-take the test if needs be.
