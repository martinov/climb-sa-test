    <h2 class="md-title">Climbing Performance Test</h2>
    <p>
      We have sourced a really good self assessment test to work out your key
			strengths and weaknesses (check out Eric J. HÃ¶rst's book
			<a href="http://www.trainingforclimbing.com/" target="_blank">Training for Climbing</a>).
			It's good to take stock especially if your performance has plateaued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add up each category to attain three totals. If all three areas are
			within five points of each other you are a well-balanced climber but,
			more commonly, you will have one that is much lower scoring than the
			others. This is your major weakness. Review each question of
			the self-assessment test and mark a star next to those on which you
			scored a three or less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these low scoring questions identifies a specific element of your
			climbing performance that is holding you back. Focus on your most
			dramatic weaknesses (5-6 lowest scoring items). Work out an action plan
			then once you begin to see improvement shift your focus onto other low
			scoring areas of the assessment. Re-take the test if needs be.
